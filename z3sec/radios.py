Generic interface for communicating with radio devices.

This module provides generic interfaces for different radio devices and pseudo
radios that provide utility functionality. Currently, Gnuradio and KillerBee
radio devices are supported. Furthermore, is possible to combine different radios
devices for sending and receiving packets or to use Wireshark to display all
packets being sent or received in real time.
